# Getting Started with 0-fs

It is recommended to first learn how to create a flist, as documented in [Creating Flists](../flists/creating.md).

Then see the [Create a Flist and Start a Container](https://github.com/zero-os/home/blob/master/docs/tutorials/Create_a_Flist_and_Start_a_Container.md) tutorial for an example.
